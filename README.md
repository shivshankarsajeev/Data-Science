# Projects
In this data engineering project, I developed a tool to analyze and process data related to the top 10
largest banks in the world, ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. The primary objective was to
compile and transform this data into various currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, INR) based on provided
exchange rate information.
